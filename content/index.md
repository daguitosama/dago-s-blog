# Dago's Blog

Hi Im Dago, i do freelance web design and development. This blog is under active development. The two main reasons i made it is to **share** and **keep track** of the **things i learn**, so maybe you will find it useful too.

While I craft some stuff I will live you with this tip: if some time you visit the Havana, check out La Quinta de los Molinos, look how Carmen likes it.
